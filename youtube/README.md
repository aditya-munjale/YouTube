- Main focus on functionality

- Task 1:

  - After click on menu button it should collaps
  - create redux store to store state
  - installed redux / redux-store
  - created store
  - created slice
  - provided our store to app

  - How to check out store working fine or not?

    - extension (Redux dev tool)
    - useSelector (subscribing specific part of out code with redux store)

    - store → the whole Redux store
    - store.app → the state managed by appSlice
    - store.app.isMenuOpen → the actual value (true/false)

- Task 2:

  - Created button lists

- Task 3:

  - Build VideoContainer (Accessing data from API)

- Task 4: (setup Routing)
  - what is outlet? 
    --> The Outlet component in React Router DOM is a placeholder used within a parent route component to render its child route elements, enabling nested UI to display when child routes are matched.
    It allows for the creation of shared layouts, such as a navigation bar or sidebar, which remain consistent across multiple pages while dynamically rendering different content based on the current route


- Task 5: Making cards clickable
    - used Link component for move to another page
    - also made Home clickable
