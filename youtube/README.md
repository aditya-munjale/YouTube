- Main focus on functionality 

- Task 1:
  - After click on menu button it should collaps
  - create redux store to store state 
  - installed redux / redux-store
  - created store 
  - created slice
  - provided our store to app

  - How to check out store working fine or not?
    - extension (Redux dev tool)
    - useSelector (subscribing specific part of out code with redux store)

    - store → the whole Redux store
    - store.app → the state managed by appSlice
    - store.app.isMenuOpen → the actual value (true/false)
